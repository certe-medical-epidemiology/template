# The `certetemplate` package for R

#### General Information

This is an R package developed by [**Certe**](https://www.certe.nl), a non-profit medical laboratory in the Northern Netherlands that provides routine diagnostic tests for clinical chemistry and clinical microbiology, as well as medical logistics and a thrombosis service. Their department of Medical Epidemiology, which developed this R package, conducts (and develops new methods for) medical data analyses, for both routine workflows and scientific research.

For all our packages, please visit to [our GitHub organisation overview](https://github.com/certe-medical-epidemiology). Our R packages are not on CRAN since their use is primarily intended for own staff, but they are publicly available to support open science. All our R packages are published [here at R-universe](https://certe-medical-epidemiology.r-universe.dev), allowing anyone to install and update the packages using common methods, such as the RStudio menu bar or `install.packages()`. To use the R-universe of Certe Medical Epidemiology, run:

```r
# set the repos option to include the Certe R-universe
options(repos = c(
  CerteMedEpi = "https://certe-medical-epidemiology.r-universe.dev",
  CRAN = "https://cloud.r-project.org"))

# to install all Certe R packages right away, download 'certedata':
install.packages("certedata")
```
